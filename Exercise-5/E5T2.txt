# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
    AWS Config Rules
    AWS CloudFormation Guard


### Example vulnerability

Hardcoded AWS Access Keys in Serverless Framework:

Example Vulnerability: In a Serverless Framework configuration file, AWS access keys are hardcoded instead of using IAM roles or environment variables. This is a significant security risk, as the keys can be exposed accidentally and lead to unauthorized access.

Open Security Groups in AWS CloudFormation:

Example Vulnerability: A CloudFormation template creates an EC2 instance with a security group that allows all inbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) on all ports. This leaves the instance vulnerable to attacks.


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Ansible

### Example vulnerability

- SSH root access with password logon

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- AWS Config
- AWS Inspector
- AWS GuardDuty

### Example vulnerability
- An IAM role assigned a policy that allows admin access
- s3-bucket-server-side-encryption
- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
