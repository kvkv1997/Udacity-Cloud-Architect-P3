# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce
Similar to the SSHBruteForce finding, this finding is specific to Windows instances and indicates multiple failed RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) login attempts within a short period, suggesting a brute force attack against a Windows instance.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty detects the "UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce" finding by analyzing logs for patterns of suspicious activity related to RDP brute force attacks on EC2 instances. It looks for multiple failed RDP login attempts from a single source IP address within a short time, checks for anomalous behavior, verifies the reputation of the source IP, and uses pattern recognition and machine learning. When such activity is detected, GuardDuty generates the finding and sends an alert for further investigation and mitigation.
